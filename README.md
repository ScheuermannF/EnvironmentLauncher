# EnvironmentLauncher
A simple GUI for starting/stopping our various local development environments

This app will only work if your 3 environments are already set up, prior to use.

To use:
* Build and archive the app using Xcode, or use a prebuilt archive
* once the app has opened, change the 5 directories to the FULL PATH of where your repos are
* Test each environment to make sure nothing is wrong

NOTE: NextGen is notoriously slow starting and stopping, so don't try to start another environment until atleast 10 or so seconds have passed
